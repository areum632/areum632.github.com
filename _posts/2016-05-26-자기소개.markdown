#Self introduction  

Hello, My name is **Lee Areum**. I am currently majoring in computer science and engineering department. 
I am `23`years old. 
It's totally random fact, but I am definitely a _cat person_. I really love cats.
Recently, I won a prize in kind of huge and important competetion. So I feel quite happy these days since I worked so hard for that competetion. 
I also hope to bring some good result in terms of major.
